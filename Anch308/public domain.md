four factor test
1. purpose and character of use
	* copyright law has the intention of stimulating creativity, profit is not a sufficient motive
	* a use must be transformative, not just derivative
	* commercial use viewed with skepticism, nonprofit/educational use more likely viewed as okay
2. nature of the copyrighted work
	* availability of copyright does not depend on artistic quality
	* fiction v nonfiction **is relevant!**
	* facts and ideas aren't copyrightable, **only their fixed expressions**
	* public interest can overrule copyright law, see JFK
3. amount of work copied
	* in general, smaller is better but NOT legally covered
	* space-shifting, time-shifting, thumbnail images are allowed
