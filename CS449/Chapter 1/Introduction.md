# Computer Software
* What is computer software?
	* Programs
	* Procedures
	* Documentation
	* Associated Data
	* ...pertaining to the operation of a computer system
* Losses from software failure total at least $1.7 trillion
* [[Project Failure#Sample Failures]]
# Software Defects
* Errors are a part of daily life.
* Errors arise in all development activities
	* Requirements Specification
	* Interpretation of Requirements
	* Design
	* Coding
	* Data Entry
	* Testing
	* Error Correction
* Hard to detect/remove all potential defects
# Defects vs. Software Size
* In general, larger projects are much more prone to failure than smaller ones.
* Defect rate (density)
	* Number of defects per 1,000 lines of code (KLOC)
# Software Development Performance

# What is Software Engineering?
[[Software Engineering#Systematic]]
[[Software Engineering#Disciplined]]
[[Software Engineering#Quantifiable]]
# Goals of Software Development
* [[Quality]]
	* [[Correctness]]
	* [[Reliability]]
	* [[Performance]]
	* [[Security]]
	* [[Usability]]
* Meets schedule/budget

# Non-Functional Requirements
* Extra constraints on the functionality
	* [[Reliability]], [[Security]], [[Performance]], and [[Usability]]
* Example: online payment
	* Functional: user can use credit card to make payment
			* [[Correctness]]: does the feature work as specified?
	* Non-functional:
		* [[Performance]]: how much time does it take?
		* [[Security]]: can the card information be leaked?
		* [[Usability]]: is it convenient to make payment?

# Trade-offs
* Sometimes, you need to make trade-offs between functional/non-functional requirements.
	* A feature may be unrealistic if
		* it's hard to implement correctly ([[Correctness]])
		* security risk is too high ([[Security]])
		* performance is too low ([[Performance]])
	* A security feature may affect performance or usability.

# Software Engineering Profession
* Lots of people write programs
	* Scientists, engineers, hobbyists, etc.
	* For their own enjoyment
* *Professional* software development
	* Software is developed for business purposes, for inclusion in other devices, or as products
	* Intended for use by someone else
	* Not individual programming
	* Founded upon CS/Software Engineering education
* In general, a **profession**
	* requires training and education
	* is backed by a professional association
	* has certification and licensing that can be used to assess competency
	* has a **code of professional ethics** that sets standards of behavior for its members
* Software engineering profession:
	* Software engineers should “commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession.” (IEEE)
