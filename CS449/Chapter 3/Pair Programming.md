# Ping-Pong
- Two developers pass the keyboard back and forth in TDD
	- A writes failing test, then passes to B
	- B writes code to pass test
	- B writes another test and passes keyboard back to A
	- A writes code to make the new test pass
- Challenge one another to solve the problem

# Driver-Navigator
- Driver types in code at the keyboard, working *tactically*
- Navigator thinks *strategically* about where the code needs to go and
	- architecture, problems, improvements
- Pair may swap roles often
- Not only programming, but also analysis, design, refactoring, testing, etc.

# Benefits
- Holds up better under stress than solo development
	- Pairs encourage each other to keep quality high
- Code readability tends to rise to the level of the best programmer on the team
- It shortens schedules - pairs tend to write code faster and with fewer errors.
- It has benefits of collaborative construction
	- disseminating corporate culture, mentoring junior programmers, and fostering collective ownership
