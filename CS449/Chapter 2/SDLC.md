# Software Development Life Cycle
* Describes the defined software processes for the development of a software product
	* Temporal relationships among the processes (which process produces other processes' inputs)
		* Requirements process's output: requirements specification
		* Often as an input for the design, construction, testing processes
	* Control mechanisms for applying the entry and exit criteria of the processes
		* Project reviews
		* Customer approvals
		* Quality thresholds
		* Demonstrations and team consensus

# SDLC vs. Software Processes
* Software development activities can be organized in a multi-dimensional or hierarchical fashion.
	* SDLC consists of multiple processes
	* A process may contain sub-processes
* It facilitates the management of complex software development projects
* SDLC model
	* An abstract representation of an SDLC that specifies the critical software processes and their temporal and logical inter-dependencies.

# Waterfall
* Sequential stages with little or no backtracking
* Has been modified in various ways
## Waterfall Steps
* Requirements
	* system and software requirements
* Analysis
	* analyzes requirements
	* identifies stakeholders
	* determines scope and constraints
	* develops business logic
* Design
	* architecture, database, UI
* Coding
* Testing
* Operations
## Waterfall Advantages
* Easy to understand and manage
	* Each phase has clearly defined deliverables to review and approve
* Provides requirements/design specifications in great detail
	* Facilitates communication among the members and the onboarding process of new members
* Ensures predictable end results
	* Facilitates resource allocation (budget/time)

## Waterfall Disadvantages
* Difficult to accomodate changes
	* Requirements *must* be known up front
* Many risks are not resolved until late
	* No feedback from stakeholders
	* Significant problems are not discovered until testing
	* Defect removal in the late phases is more costly
* Lack of parallelism
	* Inefficient use of resources
	* Different phases require different roles/competencies
	* Workload for each individual may be imabalanced
