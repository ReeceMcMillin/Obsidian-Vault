# Zero Product Rule
Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$. If $xy = 0$, then $x = 0$ or $y = 0$.

Proof:
Assume that $xy = 0$. We consider two cases, according to whether $x = 0$ or $x \neq 0$.
- Case 1: $x = 0$. Then we have the desired conclusion.
- Case 2: $x \neq 0$. Multiplying $xy = 0$ by the number $\tfrac{1}{x}$, we obtain $\tfrac{1}{x}(xy) = \tfrac{1}{x}(0) = 0$
  Since $$\tfrac{1}{x}(xy) = \tfrac{x}{x}y = y$$
  it follows that $y = 0$.
# The Triangle Inequality
For every two real numbers $x$ and $y$, $|x+y| \leq |x|+|y|$.

Proof:
Since $|x+y| = |x|+|y|$ if $x$ or $y$ is 0, we can assume that $x$ and $y$ are nonzero. We proceed by cases.
- Case 1: $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. Then $x + y > 0$ and
$$|x + y| = x + y = |x| + |y|$$
- Case 2: $x < 0$ and $y < 0$. Since $x + y < 0$,
$$|x + y| = -(x + y) = (-x) + (-y) = |x| + |y|$$
