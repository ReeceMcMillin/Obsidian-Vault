## Least Element
An element is called a **least element** of $A$ if $x \geq m$ for every $x \in A$.
The least element of $\mathbb{N}$ is 1, while $\mathbb{Z}$ has no least element.
## Well-Ordered Set
A nonempty set $S$ of real numbers is said to be **well-ordered** if every nonempty subset of $S$ has a least element.

The [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]] is a consequence of the Well-Ordering Principle.
