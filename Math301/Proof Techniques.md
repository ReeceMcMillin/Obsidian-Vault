# Direct Proof
$$\forall x \in S, P(x) \implies Q(x)$$
Assume $P(x)$ is true for an arbitrary element $x \in S$ and attempt to show that $Q(x)$ is true for the same element $x$.
# Proof by Cases
Direct proof, but split into *cases*. Often used for **biconditionals**.
# Proof by Contrapositive
$$\forall x \in S, \neg Q(x) \implies \neg P(x)$$
If not $P(x)$, then not $Q(x)$.
# Proof by Contradiction
To prove $$\forall x \in S, P(x) \implies Q(x)$$ assume $$\exists x \in S: P(x) \wedge \neg Q(x)$$
Assume the opposite of the statement and prove a contradiction.
